R package for processing and grading multiple choice exams at Wageningen
University and Research.

Multiple choice answers sheets from students at Wageningen University
and Research are generally scanned and processed into a Microsoft Excel
worbook, containing a worksheet named with the course code, by
EDUsupport (part of ITsupport). The used multiple choice answer sheets,
however, also allow for scanning and processing with the free, open
source OMR (optical mark recognition) software FormScanner
(<http://www.formscanner.org/>). This package can convert the resulting
FormScanner csv-file (in reality a semicolon separated file) into a
Microsoft Excel workbook with the same content layout as generated by
EDUsupport.

Next the Microsoft Excel workbook is used as one of the required inputs
for grading the student multiple choice answer sheets. Other required
files are:

-   a file containing the answer key for the various versions (at most
    4: A, B, C, D) used,
-   a file containing the students that registered for the exam,
-   a file containing the practicum information about the students,
    whether they passed the practicum and whether or not they have
    earned a bonus to be added to the exam grade.
